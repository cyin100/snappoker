# Snap Poker (MVP v5e)
- Not-found lobby page uses curly apostrophe and centers panel with **Back to Home** button.
- Guest nickname + ready: UI now ensures join before nickname/ready writes, so guest updates apply and ready counts.
- `poker.ts` converted to semicolon style to silence missing-semicolon lints.

## Run
npm i
npm run dev
